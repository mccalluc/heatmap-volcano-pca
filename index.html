    This page can serve as a model for a template in Refinery,
    with heatmap_scatterplot.js being pulled in during the refinery build,
    and a real refinery.js providing the connection to the API which is mocked
    here by mock_refinery.js.
</p>
<p>
    Note that nothing in this html dictates the visualization to be generated.
    If all the required 3rd party libraries are in place, then adding a new
    visualization to Refinery should be as easy as including one more
    visualization AMD during the build.
